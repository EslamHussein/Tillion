# Tillion


## Inspiration
Last year we want to buy a car and it costed around 400,000 LE and this mean if we could save around 15K per month we might have it now. But, every time we try to do this we fail to save money on monthly basis we whether lose track or spent more than required.  So, we made "Tillion" personal targeted savings application.

## What it does
Tillion is personal savings management mobile application that helps people set and track their targeted savings through their banking service.
This will be done through mobile application connected with customer bank account . 

From customer perspective, Tillion will make it easy for him to incrementally achieve target on timely manner. Also, it will show best offers in market (i.e. He would like to get a $20,000 car, so the application will suggest all offers that its price are around this number).

From the bank perspective, it will help banks acquire customers and to reach more diverse segments.
Banking, like most services online, is becoming multi-channel, there is a need to re-imagine and reinvent the approach towards end-to-end customer experience across all customer touch points.
